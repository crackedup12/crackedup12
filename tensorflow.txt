Tensorflow helps us to build deep learning models and architecture

what is tenserflow?

.End-to-end platflorm for machine learning
.write fast deep learning code in python/other accessible language
.able to access pre-build deep learning models.
.whole stack: preprocess data,model data,deploy model in your application.
.originally designed and used in-house by google. 

why tensorflow?

.Easy model building
.Robust model building anywhere
.powerful experimentation for research.
