neural network
a computer system modelled on the human brain and nervous system.
This is a rather bookish defenition. 

To elaborate we need to first convert our unstructured data into numerical encoding
.using which we will create a neural network based on the given data. And finally
get our representation data.

using the representation data we will covert it into human understandable language.
so that it can finally give us our desired output.

anatomy of neural network

.Input layer:- This is where the data goes

.Hidden layer:- This is where the pattern if formed amoung data.

.Output layer:- output learned representation or prediction probability.

Types of learning

.supervised learning:-This is where we get data and label.

.semi-supervied learning:-This is where we have almost same data as supervised learning
but only have label for some. 

.unsupervised learning:-This is where we only able to find data but no label.

.Transfer learning:-This is the process of gathering pattern from one set of data.And
using that pattern on another set of data.
