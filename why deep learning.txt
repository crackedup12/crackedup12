To answer this question we need to see take the help of an example. while driving a 
car do we try to find all the set of rules while driving it or we just drive it based
on our instincts that we gain from driving it from our previous knowledge. 
complex problems like self driving car cannot be broken down into a set of rules.
hence traditional algorithm will not work.
Here is where deep learning comes in.

where to use deep learning

. problems with long list of rules-when the traditional approach fails.
. enviroments that changes pretty quickly- since deep learning can adapt
. when large amount of data is required to be studied.

where not to use deep learning

.when you need explainability- patterns learned by deep learning are 
not interpretbale by humans
.when traditional approach is a better option.
.when error are unacceptable-since the output of deep learning model is not always
predictable
.when you do not have huge amount of data.

Machine learning is usally used for structured data. 
whereas deep learning is mostly used for unstructured data like for example voice 
recognition, identifying food and etc.
